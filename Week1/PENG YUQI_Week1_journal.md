##### My own personal progress:

1. Read the data and understand the meaning of each feature

2. Group the features based on their meaning, usage and origin

3. Discuss key questions with team members

4. Draw a logic tree representing the hypothesis based on the data (attached pdf )



##### What I have learnt

1. How to understand the use case and data in a business

2. A new method to generate hypotheses



##### How I can do better

1. In the logic tree, there are still some unclear expressions which need to be further explained

2. I can look for some external data as data support for the hypothesis
