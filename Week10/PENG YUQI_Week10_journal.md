##### My own personal progress:

1. Deep dive into our dormant users' group. Find more characteristics of this group of users, by studying their behavior during the four weeks before they churn.

2. Locate the target users in the data set, then extract their data for the first four weeks of churn, and visualize changes in their behavior.

3. Found some interesting user characteristics through analysis and gave marketing suggestions based on these characteristics.



##### What I have learnt

1. Double confirm if the strategies we give have not already been adopted/experimented by Gotrade on their app.
   
2. After we get some observations, it's better to add our analysis of those results and what we can do with them.
