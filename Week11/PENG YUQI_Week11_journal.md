##### My own personal progress:

1. Adjust the order and design of our final presentation slides based on our instructorâ€™s feedback

2. Replot our exploration to make the information conveyed by the graphs richer and easier to understand.

3. Prepare for our final presentation 



##### What I have learnt & How I can do better

1. On pages with visualized observations, highlight the key points they convey, and make sure information or key messages are not repeated across sections of our current slide
  
2. Make the slide title more descriptive
