##### My own personal progress:

1. Use external data to improve user information

2. Find the sector to which all traded stocks belong. Analyze the user's interest in each sector based on the number of trades and the trading volume in each sector.

3. Use the generated feature to draw distribution plots, conduct statistics and analysis from both a overall trading perspective and an individual user's perspective.
4. Organize and present on our achievements.



##### What I have learnt

1. When performing cluster modeling, the selection of features used should be more carefully considered.

2. During the presentation, the focus should be on our results rather than our progress.



##### How I can do better

1. Group our users based on their level of risk tolerance
2. Use newly generated labels in clustering to see if any interesting patterns can be uncovered.
3. make some business recommendation based on our model.
