##### My own personal progress:

1. Group our users based on their level of risk tolerance, give each user a new feature based on their risk tolerance.
2. Use the newly generated features to perform data exploration in each cluster, such as the user's investment amount in each sector and the user's risk tolerance.
3. Based on the clustering results and training features, check the clustering effect, and find the characteristics of each category. Propose some marketing strategies based on these user characteristics.



##### What I have learnt

1. The presented data and graphs must support the conclusions
2. Define the characteristics of each cluster in simple and understandable terms, and explain how they differ from other clusters.



##### How I can do better

1. Try modeling with different features, and find the attribute that best explains the difference between clusters

2. Present the characteristics of each cluster using language and diagrams that could be easy understand by the clients.

3. Rehearse before the presentation to control the speaking time.
