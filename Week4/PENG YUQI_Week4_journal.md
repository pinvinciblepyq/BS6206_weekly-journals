##### My own personal progress:

1. Refine our model by trying different feature combinations
2. Based on the clustering results and training features, check the clustering effect, and find the characteristics of each category. Propose some marketing strategies based on these user characteristics.

3. Change the pattern of the graphs so readers can see the information more clearly

4. Prepare for the first presentation



##### What I have learnt

1. When introducing the characteristics of each group, it is best to use comparation to highlight the main characteristics of a certain group.
2. For some self generated features, it is better to summarize its meaning in precise language rather than introducing how the feature was built.



##### How I can do better

1. Perform cohort analysis

2. Explore the dormant user group during the time they were active

3. Prepare for case study 2
