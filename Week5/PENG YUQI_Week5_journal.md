##### My progress:

1. Modify our slide according to our mentors' suggestions, make the data observation and marketing strategy more closely integrated.
2. Give the first presentation to our client.



##### What I have learnt

3. In order to make the logic of our presentation clearer, we can bold the key observation points and then repeat them when we are giving marketing strategy based on these points
