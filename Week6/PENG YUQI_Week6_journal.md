##### My own personal progress:

1. Meet with our mentors and listen to their feedback on our case study one presentation.

3. Listen to the lecture given by the company numbers, and learn about the process and techniques in case study two.



##### What I have learnt

1. The important role of user behavior prediction and how to build a model to achieve this.
2. Some basic understanding of SHAP value analysis



##### How I can do better

1. When visualizing our data, we can add more visual factors to each graph. For example, we can assign a color to a group and  use this color to present some important characteristics of this group, or use this color to represent this group in graphs.
2. For our dormant user group, which confuses our client in the presentation, we need to give a more accurate definition and dig out more characteristic of this group of users.
