##### My progress:

1. Assist my teammate to generate time series data of each user from the original dataset
2. Based on the features used in SHAP value analysis, I explore differences among the four user groups we define in case study 1 and find the group characteristics shown in case study two are consistent with our exploration of four groups of users in case study one



##### What I have learnt

1.  How to perform a SHAP value analysis, how to visualize the result, and how to pick out important features that have more impact on our model.
2. When generating time series data, since each period contains data from different users. In certain periods, a certain user may have a great impact on the overall average, and this impact might need to be reduced.



##### How I can do better

1. Give corresponding marketing strategies based on the characteristics of each group and the factors that affect the behavior of this group.
2. Filter and improve the time series data.
