##### My own personal progress:

1. Give marketing strategies to different groups based on features that have a great impact on user behavior. 
2. Case study two presentation



##### What I have learnt

1. When proposing the marketing strategies, it is better to link them to the observations. Even if the strategies are similar in different circumstances, we need to focus on the differences and choose different methods. For example, when we decide to reward the users based on their behaviors, we can offer them some cash back when there is an increase in their deposit value. However, we can't apply the same method to stimulate users' activity in the app which might cause fake operations.
