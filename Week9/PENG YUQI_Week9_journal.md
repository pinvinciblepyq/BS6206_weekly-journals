##### My progress:

1. Conduct cohort analysis for each group

2. Find the connection points between Case Study 1 and Case Study 2, as well as the logic between them.

3. Integrate the strategies we provided in the two case studies.



##### What I have learnt & How I can do better

1. When conducting a SHAP value analysis for each group, if it is found that the important features overlap across groups, it might be better to conduct a SHAP value analysis using the overall data directly.
2. To highlight the most important group of users for the company, a SHAP value analysis can also be conducted separately for them.
3. When giving a presentation, summarize the content of the presentation on the first page.
